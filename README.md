# Welcome to the Smith Papers Project
Welcome! This project is about digitizing and providing access to the Smith Family Papers collection, which is made up of a variety of documents that give a perspective on Southern rural life in the 20th century. Through digitizing, we aim to create widely accessible digital files for the public to use for research.

## About the Collection
The majority of the contents of the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection (referred to from here on out as the “Smith Family Papers”) includes letters, diaries, financial and academic records, wills, and birth records. Letters among family members and friends make up the majority of the collection, and most of the letters were sent among members of the Smith Family–Pauline and Sam H. and their children, Bernice, Christine, Martha, and Sam E (or “Sonny Boy.”). The geographic center of the collection is Pittsboro (or Calhoun County) Mississippi, where the family maintained their home since 1914, and where Pauline wrote most of her letters. Several letters from Sam H. Smith, who was a state senator between 1932 and 1936, were sent from Jackson, MS. Letters to and from Columbus, MS are from Bernice, Christine and Martha, who each attended and graduated from Mississippi State College for Women between 1931 and 1938. As Pauline and Sam H. grow older and continue to write from Mississippi, their children move around the country, and with a few military appointments, around the world.

## About the Process
Members of the LIB 201 class and the Smith Papers Working Group at MUW's Fant Memorial Library have worked in tandem to learn more about the Smith Family and share their story by digitizing this collection. With each of these steps, we use Asana to mark and track our progress. If you haven't been added to the <a href="https://app.asana.com/0/1198178250630033/list">Asana project</a>, ask someone involved or email the project manager to get access. 

Involved in this process are these main steps:
1. <b>Scan the letters</b>. This is done mainly with the Bookeye scanner in the Mims Digitization Lab, but the Epson scanner has also been used. Scanning also includes ensuring the quality of the digital image through cropping and deskewing. The ***3 files*** that are created are saved to the Archives hard drive, the LibArchives (R:) drive, and the shared Smith Papers Google Drive folder. The files that are saved from this are:
    * a PDF user copy
    * a TIFF preservation copy
    * a JPG for derivatives

2. <b>Create Metadata</b>. The <a href="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/metadata.md#2-metadata-standards">metadata standards</a> for this collection are based largely on archival metadata schema, but have been tweaked to allow for anyone to assist with metadata entry. Creating some parts of the metadata requires being present during scanning (e.g. Date digital, identifier, capture method, etc.), while other parts can be recorded after, during transcription (subject, description, etc.).
    * Reading through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m63PCPGmzaQQ4cbeo1vh869oOuTyBPNS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108103280018141344202&rtpof=true&sd=true">full metadata guidelines</a> is recommended, but you don't have to memorize them! 

    * Enter the metadata into a sheet in <!--insert link here--> Google Drive, which is divided up into decades for easier use. 

3. <b>Transcribe</b>. For this project we are using <a href="https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/?sc=Transkribus">Transkribus</a> to both transcribe and tag the letters. This software also has an algorithm (an HTR model, or "handwritten text recognition") that has the ability to learn and recognize handwriting, and can reduce the amount of time spent on transcribing. Otherwise, transcribing can be done with a text editor like Notepad or Visual Studio Code.
    * Before transcribing your first document, read through the <a href="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/transcribing.md">Introduction to Transcribing Documents lesson</a>. This explains things like methods for transcribing, how to use the software, and how to tag items.
    * Deciphering handwriting can be difficult, so take a screenshot of something and share it with the Team if you're having trouble!
    * Transcriptions are saved as .txt files and uploaded to both the Google Drive folder and AthenaCommons.

4. <b>Quality check</b>. Since several people - novice and expert - are involved in this project, it's important to share the metadata, transcriptions, and whatever other work you've generated. It's also important to remember that, even though consistency is key, this collection is so large and sprawling that perfection is not the goal! Aim for communication and consistency, and pay as much attention to detail as you can; but if you spend your time on one-word spelling errors or metadata quibbles, you'll never get past one letter!

5. <b>Upload</b>. While the components of the letters are uploaded several times along the way (Google Drive and LibArchives), the ultimate goal is to make the collection and its derivative files available to anyone. The ways we're currently doing that are through:
    * AthenaCommons - the institutional repository which houses digital collections, and
    * CollectionBuilder - our exhibit of files in github.

Once files have been created and proofed, it's time to upload them! Once they're open and available, we can begin analyzing them and producing scholarship. At this writing, we've created many artifacts (a <a href="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/network-analysis.md">network analysis</a> of letter writers and people mentioned, <a href="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/mapping.md">map and a timeline</a> of the TVA bringing electricity to the area, a <a href="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis.md">text analysis</a> of themes in the letters, and <a href="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative.md">narrative project</a> that combined  these artifacts in a <a href="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/LIB201-Fall2021-narrative.md">final portfolio</a>.
